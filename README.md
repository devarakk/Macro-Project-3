# Macro-Project-3
**Data sources**

Data for part 1 came from the OECD's economic outlook.

**Steps for data cleaning and analysis**

The python script details the instructions for cleaning and analyzing the data. It pivots the data around the different macroeconomic variables. It converts the time variable to datetime format. The data frame was then limited to the macroeconomic variables, and standard deviation and correlation was calculated for these variables, grouped by country. Finally, this data was graphed for each variable for each country.

**Instructions for reproducing results**

Go to the OECD Data Explorer and download the variables specified in the paper for Germany, Australia, and the United States. The frequency must be quarterly and data goes back to 2002. Then run the Python Script to clean and analyze the data, including producing standard deviations, correlations, and graphs.
